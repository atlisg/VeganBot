To simply say \"please consider not stabbing animals\" is a very reasonable suggestion, is it not? Nobody is in a position to \"force\" you to do anything, if you want to keep stabbing animals, I am not in a position to prevent you.\nIndeed, from a non-vegans perspective, your opinion is that animals should be stabbed in the neck.

Veganism isn't about dogmatically and irrationally saying \"I am perfect, I harm nothing\". It is about recognising the harm that is being done by our society, and trying to make a change, avoid being part of it - as far as we can. In future, as more and more people go vegan, there will be more and more alternatives developed because research will be put into new technology.

In addition, a B12 supplement is injected into livestock to keep their levels up due to top soil being too intensively used and lacking in certain nutrients.

Either he is culled immediately, or he is sold into the veal industry and then killed after a few weeks of living in confinement, or he is sold into the beef industry and killed as soon as he reaches a profitable size, which will be about one year old. If the calf is female, typically she will be removed from her mother so that the milk can be stolen, and then she is used in the same manner.

When honey is stolen, it is then replaced with a syrup alternative, which is not the same as honey, and is essentially depriving the bee of their natural food. Bee hives are extremely sensitive and opening them up is highly unnatural for the bees, who work to keep a particular atmosphere inside, which gets disrupted. On top of this, selective inbreeding of bees has weakened the species as a whole, and transportation of bees to places and environments they'd not normally travel to means transportation of diseases that would not normally affect the local population of bees, which is hazardous to bees in general.

The very definition of grass-fed/organic/free-range animals is actually very loose and can vary wildly. It doesn't mean that the animals have any kind of quality of life necessarily, it just means the farm has to meet some arbitrary requirements to earn that title.

There is no comparison to be made here.\nPut yourself in this position - you are suffering horribly and you know you will never survive. Would you consider taking death? Maybe.

Likewise, if you have a country of 10 million non-vegans, do you think if that country instead had 5 million vegans and 5 million non-vegans, that the animal farming industry would be the same size? Again, of course not. Shops sell animal products, and then restock appropriately. If something isn't selling as well, they will order less. As such, the warehouses they stock from will then have appropriately sized orders from those shops, and will stock less ingredients to make those products, which means ordering less animal products from slaughterhouses and farms, which means less demand for animals to be bred in the first place.

If somebody killed your companion animal, I doubt you'd say \"that's fine because you did it humanely\" as described above.", "21": "Bringing a life into the world does not justify taking it. And think this through - in the egg industry, as soon as males are hatched, they are killed. Immediately. Did you really do that chicken a favour by bringing them into the world, to then immediately be killed? Nobody can seriously say yes to this, but that is precisely what is going on every day, and you fund that if you buy eggs.\nAnimals bred for meat are killed as soon as they reach a profitable size, which will typically be a few months old, or about a year. You didn't do that animal any favours.\nFinally, let's extend this to animals besides livestock. You have a dog, they're pregnant. Does that mean you can slit the puppies' throats, because you were the one who arranged for your dog to get pregnant? Of course not, it's nothing to do with it.", "11": "Religion is based upon ancient scripture, tradition, dogma and superstition. Veganism is based on having consideration for animals, and a desire to avoid animal abuse. Animal abuse is real, animals are being exploited and killed in their billions. It's a reality, can be proven to you. You might say it's a matter of opinion that we'd like to avoid it happening, but if you claim to have any consideration for animals whatsoever, then you will be in agreement.", "27": "What is this based on? Let's use dogs as an example as that's the most commonly respected animal, in my experience.\n- Dogs are our companions\nPractically any animal could be your companion if you gave them the chance. People keep pigs as companions, and form bonds with them as strong as you can with a dog.\n- I just like dogs, I don't have a connection with other animals\nThat is not a justification for killing other animals. Somebody could equally say to you \"I don't have a connection with your dog, so I am going to slit their throat\". Just because of how you feel about an animal, doesn't mean that animal is disposable, they are sentient beings.\n- Dogs are intelligent, other animals are dumb\nThat is not a justification for killing them. Other animals such as cats, hamsters and so on could be said to be less intelligent than dogs, that doesn't mean you think killing them is fine presumably. But as it happens, pigs are in many ways more intelligent than dogs, able to make connections and solve problems more advanced than anything dogs can do, and can interact on a higher level with video games, they can recognise human faces, understand reflections in a mirror, respond to commands and so on. If you have any serious consideration for animals, feel free to look up articles on chicken intelligence, cattle intelligence, sheep intelligence and so on. It is out of the question that dogs are alone as being intelligent animals.\n- Companion animals are my property, like my TV\nThis is an absurd comparison. The reason why you'd be upset with someone killing your dog is not because they are your property, it's because they are sentient beings, living their own life, and you don't want harm to come to them. Damage to your TV is a financial loss, your companion animals are more than that surely?\n- Just our culture, it's actually fine to slit dog's throats as long as it's done in another culture not this one\nThat makes no sense at all. Following through with this statement, you'd be appalled if a dog was killed in front of you, but apparently if that same dog was transported to another country where it is culturally acceptable to kill them, then you'd say it was fine. Think it through - it's the same dog, precisely the same thing is happening to them. Why does it matter where it happens?\n- Dogs have been companions of humans for hundreds of years\nThat is just because humans have chosen for it to be that way, it isn't the fault of other animals. You could make a companionship with any animal if you chose, there's no reason to be killing them just because you chose not to make a friend of them.\n- You can play catch with a dog and they do tricks\nYou can do the same with many other species. But why do you want to kill animals who don't want to play catch? Most cats don't want to play catch, they might do other things, but most don't retrieve things and play catch like dogs do, but it doesn't logically follow that you must slit a cat's throat.\n- Dogs are cute\nWhy do you discriminate against animals based upon what they look like? If you come across a dog that isn't cute, are you compelled to slit their throat? If someone doesn't find your dog cute, is it okay for them to slit their throat?\n- Yeah but it's because I have a connection with my animal, they're like family. Killing animals outside my family is fine.\nThis is a direction comparison between humans and dogs. Therefore, you are saying that killing your dog would be bad because they're like family. Killing anyone outside your family is therefore fine, would you apply this to strangers then? A human stranger is not part of your family, unlike your dog. The argument of \"you're humanizing animals\" cannot be used, because you are the one humanizing animals in this case, comparing them to your family. Just because an animal or human is outside your family is no grounds to slit their throat. Also, think this through. If you have an animal that currently isn't in your family, you're arguing that it's fine to slit their throat. But if you chose to instead adopt them, then immediately it's abhorrent to slit that animal's throat. It's the same animal. Look at this from the animal's perspective, not your own.", "19": "This is false as proven by all the hundreds of millions of vegans in the world.", "49": "First of all, if you're really serious about this and no amount of scientific evidence will sway you - then it purely comes down to numbers. If a blade of grass is of the same importance to you as a dog, then it makes no sense to feed up livestock on millions and millions of plants, and then kill the animal to eat. This would result in far more plant casualties, which you'd surely want to avoid as a dedicated plants-rights activist. Better to minimize those plant casualties by just feeding yourself on them, rather than feeding many times more to animals, right?\nBut let's be sensible - plants lack brains and lack anything else that neuroscientists know to cause sentience. Some studies show plants to have input/output reactions to certain stimulation, but no study suggests sentience or an ability to \"feel emotions\". You can plainly understand the difference between a blade of grass and a dog. Comparisons between the two are completely absurd.", "20": "Following this logic, if somebody has a dog living with them, and she is pregnant, then simply standing there and saying \"When those puppies are born I am going to kill them all\" would be enough justification for doing so. That of course is absurd. Basically, you are not in a position to determine the fate of an animal. If the argument is that some animals have been selectively bred for consumption, then again, that is not a justification. The entire process of selectively breeding them was done at the hands of humans, and all subsequent loss of life is at their say so and is entirely unnecessary.", "10": "Even if you think that morality is subjective, your ethics should still be backed by logic. They are not random, nor are they plucked from thin air. As such, the question is simple - do you have any consideration for animals or not? Most people would say that they care about animals, or at the very least, would not like to needlessly harm them. Farming animals for our consumption is needless, and so all harm visited upon them including their slaughter, is needless also. So your own subjective view should be to avoid harming them - if you have any consideration for them whatsoever.", "17": "Regardless of what it says in the bible, you are not obliged to kill animals as part of your religion. Nobody would argue that the christian god would send you to hell if you are vegan surely. There isn't a quota for how many animals you have to kill per day. So religion isn't a factor here.", "47": "To feed animals to the age of slaughter, it requires many times more plants to be harvested than if we just ate plants ourselves. You might argue that we could instead just eat exclusively grass-fed animals who do not require grain, but this is entirely impractical. Firstly, most \"grass-fed\" animals are not fed 100% grass anyway, and secondly, it's not sustainable at all to try to feed 7 billion people exclusively on grass-fed beef. There isn't the space available for such a thing, and good luck living exclusively off beef and nothing else.\nWhilst there will be casualties in crop harvesting, and whilst vegans would prefer it not the be the case - it is the least harmful thing most people can do. Obviously, it would be even less harmful to grow your own crops on your own property and pick them by hand, without spraying, and without using machinery which can run down animals. But most people don't have the space available to do that to feed themselves at all, let alone all year round every year. So out of all practical options available, it is least harmful - and hopefully in future, as people start to have more respect for animals and more accountability for how we treat them, more advances will be made in crop harvesting in ways that minimize casualties.", "58": "Many people like to make the argument that X people will die unless we experiment on Y animals, therefore it's justified as human life is more important, and if you outlaw animal testing then you have essentially just killed X people.\nIt isn't as simple as that, because actually animal testing has alternatives. Companies like http://www.drhadwentrust.org are working to continue medical research, without having to torture, exploit and kill animals.\nThere is another question - is animal testing even useful to us, as we are very different to animals? Read more here to learn more.\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/aysha-akhtar/why-animal-experimentatio_b_3997568.html", "46": "The fact is that a high percentage of foods that everybody eats regularly are vegan. Bread, pasta, rice, cereal, soups, many brands of cookies, chips/crisps, fries, spaghetti, roast vegetables, baked potato, curries, stir fries, many pastries, donuts and so on, can all be vegan without you even realising. To discredit all food that does not contain animal products is ridiculous, come on. But on top of this, with a little research, you can find simple alternatives to anything you want, or just swap out a single ingredient in a recipe and you can continue to eat what you already were pretty much.\nYou might have tried a brand of non-dairy milk and disliked it - there are hundreds of brands of milks made of different things, almonds, rice, oats etc. Some are sweetened, some are not - but please try them in context. Whether that's in your cereal or in your coffee, once it's in there you will find that any difference is negligible. Similarly with any other substitute you may have tried - cheese, meat, anything. There are so many brands, don't discount them because you had a bad experience.\nSome people complain about tofu, saying it is bland. If that is your experience, then honestly it wasn't prepared properly. If you take a handful of plain flour out of the bag and eat it, you shouldn't be surprised that it's disgusting. Does that mean you're not going to eat bread, bagels, pasta, cakes or noodles anymore because you don't like plain flour? Of course not. Read up on tofu recipes - or don't even eat tofu if you really don't want it. You don't need it! Find foods that you do like, and eat those!"}
